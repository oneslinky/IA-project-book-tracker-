Book title:Darkness take my hand
You can't save people. Particularly when a person isn't even asking to be saved.~We bounce and collide and smash our way through our lives, and for the most par, we're on out own. ~I guess my impulse had something to do with growing older, with looking back and seeing very few innocent violences committed against the young, in knowing that every tiny pain scars and ships away at what is pure and infinitely breakable in a child~Or maybe i was just in a bad mood~It never goes away. the worry. the fear. not for a second. that's the price of bringing life into this world ~People, my mother once claimed, cannot be fully understood, only reacted to ~You can love more than one person at the same time ~humans are messy~He died because he loved us too much and we didn't love him enough~And everything was so goddamned funny for some reason;
Book title:The Alchemist
It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting ~Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own~It's this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what's happening to us, and out lives become controlled by fate. That's the world's greatest lie~When each day is the same as the next, it's because people fail to recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises~The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon~It was the language of enthusiasm of things accomplished with love and purpose, and as part of a search for something believed in and desired ~When someone makes a decision, his is really diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision~People need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want~Most people see that world as a threatening place, and, because they do, the world turns out, indeed, to be a threatening place ~There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure;
