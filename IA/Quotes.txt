The alchemist~It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting~Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own~It's this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what's happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That's the world's greatest lie~When each day is the same as the next, it's becasue people fail to recognize the godd things that happen in their lives every day that the sib rises.~The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon ~It was the language of enthusiasm, of things accomplished with love and purpose, and as part of a search for something believed in and desired~When someone makes a decision, he is really diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision~people need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want~Most people see the world as a threatening place, and, becasue they do, the world turns out, indeed, to be a threatening place~There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure
