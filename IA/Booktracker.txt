We were Dreamers~Simu Liu~5 out of 5~autobiography~Simu Liu~This is a good book about growing up asian american and the weight of expectations. Its tone is constant throughout and the jokes are well put in. Simu Liu gives amazing context to his entire family and upbringing. His story connects with many asian americans and makes him more presentable and human to the auidence ~the later half of the book gets sad due to realism of Simu's teenage years and struggle to find his profession and place in his world~
Darkness, take my hand ~Dennis Lehane~4 out of 5~Thriller ~Patrick kenzie and Angela Gennaro~This is a extremely good thriller that's main villian is revaled at a reasonable time. There is enough time to be able to discover the twist on your own but it also doesnt drag on. The characters act realistic and the underworld dealing seem possible. ~This is not a sad book~
Patron Saints of Nothing~Randy Ribay~5 out of 5~realistic fiction~Jay Reguero~An insanely good book as jay reguero to me embodies my brother and due to the similarities. This book connects the asian american experience very well and seems as if the author understands the displacement that some asian americans feel while they have family in areas that are dangerous. It also does a good job of showing how asian americans loss contact with those in the home country. Highly recomend ~very sad at the end and shows the reality of why people move but also some of the things that are lost ~
The Blind side~Michael Lewis~4 out of 5~non-fiction~Michael oher ~This is a perfect book for those that want to learn about Michael's life but also some of the things not mentioned in the movie.

The City & The City~China Miéville~4 out of 5~detective/sci-fi~Inspector Tyador Borlú, Inspector Dhatt~Book brings many interesting ideas with the different cities and how people have been brainwashed to not see the other city even though they share the same space. Also because the cities are on top of each other and share the same locations the question of what is a city is introduced. ~Not very sad~
